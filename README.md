# RAS User interface

## Overview
This repository contains the application side of RAS, visible to the user.

Takes input a pdf file, or text input, and then converts it into a linear sequence of modules, with the appropriate parameters. 

### Notes
- Right now, this model uses GPT4o for parsing the natural language input. It will be replaced later with an open source LLM suited to the purpose, along with some checks to ensure consistent performance
